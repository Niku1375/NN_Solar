  "summary": "The diff clearly introduces a new MONTHLY_BILL_MAX of 100000 and adds clamping logic for monthly bill input/slider values, including handling empty/NaN. However, the truncated SolarCalculator.tsx excerpt does not show the actual Slider props or the min/max range labels, so REQ-1’s UI/slider-max/label updates cannot be fully verified from the provided evidence.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Ensure the Monthly Electricity Bill slider max is 100000 and the UI min/max labels consistently reflect the new max (₹100,000 / ₹1,00,000), and the slider can be dragged to 100,000 with the displayed value updating accordingly.",
      "reason": "Although MONTHLY_BILL_MAX is set to 100000, the diff excerpt is truncated before the JSX showing the Slider configuration and the displayed min/max labels. Without seeing the Slider's `max` prop and the label text, the acceptance criteria for the slider max and label change cannot be confirmed.",
